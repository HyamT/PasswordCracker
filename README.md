# Hyam Cracker

Hyam Cracker is a Python-based password-cracking tool designed for educational and ethical purposes. This project demonstrates various password-cracking techniques, such as dictionary attacks, and includes advanced features like parallel processing and support for multiple hash algorithms.

ðŸš§ **This project is a work in progress!** ðŸš§  
New features and enhancements are being added regularly. Stay tuned for updates.

## **Features**

- Dictionary-based password cracking
- Support for multiple hash algorithms:
  - MD5
  - SHA-1
  - SHA-256
- Command-line interface (CLI) for flexible use
- Real-time progress display with a progress bar
- Easy-to-read results exported to CSV

### **Planned Features**
- Parallel processing to improve performance
- Graphical user interface (GUI) with Tkinter or PyQt
- Rainbow table functionality
- Hybrid attacks (dictionary + brute-force)
- Password strength analysis and reporting
- Docker support for portability

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries (install via `pip`):
  ```bash
  pip install argparse tqdm
